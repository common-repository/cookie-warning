Asks users' consent for using cookies or redirects them out of your site.

== Description ==

To comply with the May 2011 EU cookie law whose enforcement will start in May 2012 for UK website owners, this plugin welcomes your first time visitors with
a custom message asking for their consent using cookies on your website and redirects them out of your site if they disagree. It is a solution that strictly
complies with the law.

You can customize the message displayed as well as the text of the 'I agree' button and of the 'I disagree' link.

This plugin was written with the EU cookie law in mind but can be used for any terms and conditions you need your visitors to approve before
viewing your site.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I preview the changes I make to my cookie warning message? =
The point is to display the message on the user's first visit only, which makes it tricky to preview the changes you make to the cookie warning message...
Two ways around that:

1. View your site in a web browser with which you haven't viewed the site yet.
2. Clear your browser of cookies - I know... Any website feature that requires the discrimination between first time and returning visitor needs to rely on... cookies! Hopefully
the EU law makes that use of cookies legal. It's just one of its many inconsistencies!!

= Where do I go to report bugs and for complaints, moans, suggestions or to sing your praises? =
Just send an email to info at majweb dot co dot uk
